This project aims to provide a set of tools to monitor a democratic entity.
This entity can be a country, a city council or your organization.

It's **entirely static** and the best place to host it is Github Pages:
  - It's free
  - Takes less than 3 minutes to have a running instance ready to be served
  - Anyone can have access to the data and history of modifications
  - It's easy to participate

You can get a preview of the front-end with fake data on
[this link](https://democracy-watcher.herokuapp.com/)

Current implementation supports English and French but translating it
in a new language should be really quick.

This project aims to provide a set of tools to monitor a democratic entity.
This entity can be a country, a city council or your organization.

You can get a preview of the front-end with fake data on
[this link](https://democracy-watcher.herokuapp.com/)

Current implementation supports English and French but translating it
in a new language should be really quick.

I'm actively looking for collaboration on this project, feel free to contact me if you need  assistance in implementing it !
In particular, if you want to create and maintain an instance to track a French entity (your local city, DOM/TOM) I would be happy to host it for you under the France Democracy Watcher domain.

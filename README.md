# Democracy Watcher

This project aims to provide a set of tools to monitor a democratic entity.
This entity can be a country, a city council or your organization.

You can get a preview of the front-end with fake data on
[this link](https://democracy-watcher.herokuapp.com/)

Current implementation supports english and french but translating it
in a new language should be really kick.

I'm actively looking for collaboration on this project. If you're interested in
implementing it, feel free to contact me or to open a new ticket.
Especially if you want to create and maintain an instance to track a French entity
(your local city, DOM/TOM) I would be happy to host it for you under the France
Democracy Watcher domain.

## Modules

Two modules are currently available :

### Promise tracker

List promises with their description, their sources and their status. A
promise may be done, in progress, not yet started or broken.

You can also split the promises in categories (Culture, economy...etc)
which will be displayed as tabs and in subjects which will appears 
between promises

### Statistics

This section allows you to easily show data. You can use text, charts
and add sources for this data.

This project aims to provide a set of tools to monitor a democratic entity.
This entity can be a country, a city council or your organization.

You can get a preview of the front-end with fake data on
[this link](https://democracy-watcher.herokuapp.com/)

Current implementation supports english and french but translating it
in a new language should be really kick.

I'm actively looking for collaboration on this project. If you're interested in
implementing it, feel free to contact me or to open a new ticket.
Especially if you want to create and maintain an instance to track a French entity
(your local city, DOM/TOM) I would be happy to host it for you under the France
Democracy Watcher domain.
